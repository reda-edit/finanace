         <h1>STEP 1: PAY YOUR BILLS ON TIME
            Your payment history accounts for 
            approximately 35% of your credit 
            score more than any other factor. 
            If you have a history of paying 
            bills late, you need to start paying
            them on time. If you've missed payments,
            get current and stay current. 
            Each on-time payment updates
            positive information to your credit report.
            The longer your history of paying bills on 
            time, the higher that portion of your credit 
            score will be.</h1>

         <h1>STEP 2: REVIEW YOUR CREDIT REPORT
            Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act,
            the three national bureaus - Equifax, 
            Experian, and TransUnion - and your 
            creditors are responsible for correcting
            errors on your report. The Federal Trade
            Commission (FTC) website has detailed 
            steps for correcting errors, as well as a
            sample dispute letter. If you find accounts
            that aren't yours and suspect you've been
            the victim of identity theft, you'll need
            to place a fraud alert on your credit report,
            close those accounts and file a police report
            and a complaint with the FTC.</h1>

         <h1>STEP 3: PAY DOWN YOUR CARD BALANCES
            The amount of debt you have is heavily
            scrutinized for your score. Your total
            reported debt owed is taken into account,
            as well as the number of accounts with
            outstanding balances and how much available
            credit has been used. The total reported
            debt is compared to the total credit available
            to determine your debt-to-credit ratio. Your
            credit score can suffer if those numbers are too
            close together. Your best plan for lowering your
            debt is to make a plan to pay it off.
            While it may seem like a wise move, don't consolidate
            debt onto one lower interest card.
            Credit inquiries and opening new credit can
            lower your credit score, at least in the short term.
            Closing old cards with high credit limits can also
            throw off your debt-to-credit ratio. If a new credit
             offer is too good to pass up, keep your total amount
              of credit available high by not closing any old credit cards.</h1>

         <h1>STEP 4: USE CREDIT
            You must use credit regularly for creditors to update
            your credit report with current, accurate information.
            While paying with cash or a debit card may make it easier
            to keep to a budget, a cash-only lifestyle does very little
            to improve your credit score. The easiest way to use
            credit is with a credit card, especially if you're trying
            to improve your score to qualify for an installment loan.
            If you have an old credit card, start using it responsibly again.
            A long credit history is a positive determining factory for
            your credit score, so making an inactive account active again
            may be advantageous. Although you need to make a point to use
            credit regularly, only charge as much as you can pay off.
            Keep your credit balances low so as not to damage your debt-to-credit 
            ratio.</h1>

           <h1>STEP 5: MONITOR YOUR REPORT
            Keeping a watchful eye on your credit report will let you see
            if your hard work is paying off. Credit monitoring allows you
            to keep tabs on account activity. You'll also be immediately 
            tipped off about any fraudulent activity. The credit bureaus 
            and FICO offer credit monitoring services, which typically
            cost about $15 a month to monitor all three of your credit 
            reports and scores. You can also use Credit Karma or other 
            free sites alike.</h1>

          <h1>STEP 6: REVIEW YOUR REPORT
            You need to review you report from any of these error:
            
            * Accounts that aren't yours
            
            * Accounts with the wrong account date or credit limit listed
            
            * Names and Social Security numbers that aren't yours
            
            * Addresses where you've never lived
            
            * Negative information, like late payments, older than seven years. 
            (Late payments can only legally stay on your credit report for seven years.)</h1>
